- **scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?  
    i am building a knowledge aggregator that is highly internally referenceable. i think i can create something using the DR stack that has auth for users and allows users to contribute to the database.  

    - **user stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have?  
        my users will be people interested in knowlegde and trivia.

- **user flow:** What is your user doing on your site? Why are they there? How will they navigate your core features and functionality?  
    my users will be either sifting through information, reading and determining what topics are related to each other, or they will be adding their own material, whether it be information or something more personal such as poetry or opinions. they will be there because the space will represent something that is hard to replicate and rather unique. they will navigate the core features by signing up, signing in, and exploring whatever topics they are in the mood to investigate, helping to tie genres together by linking them, and they will be able to create their own articles (or posts) to add to the site.

- **wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.  

- **data models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).  

- **milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.  
    milestone #1: create a site that has users who can log in and created artices and nodes. also, the ancillary links should link to each other and auto-poplulate based on strongest affinity.  it also should be deployed early on. i may pay for AWS to see if that is any easier.  
    milestone #2: having auth for users would be nice, but not necessary.  i would like to make the 404 page look cool or clever. making the profiles be able to be edited would be nice.  
    milestone #4: this would all be about perfecting how everything looked and ran on a mobile device.  
    milestone #5: making the 404 error page interactive, possibly with a game similar to "pong," would be a cool icebox feature, basically creating an app within an app.  
  
- **feasibility study (optional):** If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. ***We will ask to see your results.***

- **user stories:**  
    As A User, i want to be able to access the site 
    AAU,
